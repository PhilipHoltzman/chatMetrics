11/13/16, 16:58:42: jelipe: this is like the adult version of that
11/13/16, 16:58:55: Morgan: Yeah found some data on him
11/13/16, 16:58:59: Morgan: Weird
11/13/16, 16:59:05: Morgan: YouTube is the worst
11/13/16, 16:59:30: jelipe: yeah
11/13/16, 16:59:42: Morgan: I don't really explore enough to see that stuff but sometimes I will see an h3h3 video
11/13/16, 16:59:45: jelipe: seeing him do all those yeager bombs made me really sick
11/13/16, 17:00:14: AndreW: H3h3 sucks
11/13/16, 17:00:17: jelipe: im kind of a workdstar hiphop guy so i see that stuff
11/13/16, 17:00:38: AndreW: All those YouTube commentators
11/13/16, 17:01:22: Morgan: I only see h3 when my housemate is playing it in the living room
11/13/16, 17:01:47: jelipe: whas that?
11/13/16, 17:01:56: Morgan: It seems like they got too involved with some stuff recently but I haven't seen that
11/13/16, 17:02:33: Morgan: Like Reddit headlines suggest he's fundraising for the hugh Mungus guy or something
11/13/16, 17:03:24: AndreW: Hugh mungus what?
11/13/16, 17:15:21: jelipe: just saw Ghost in the Shell trailer
11/13/16, 17:15:30: jelipe: ehhhhhhh
11/13/16, 17:15:45: Morgan: SJ metahuman action
11/13/16, 17:15:48: jelipe: looks really dumb
11/13/16, 17:16:07: Morgan: Haven't seen a trailer yet
11/13/16, 17:16:09: jelipe: they changed what its abot I think
11/13/16, 17:16:16: jelipe: also lesbian kiss in the trailer
11/13/16, 17:16:49: jelipe: and scarlet johan seems dumb
11/13/16, 17:16:55: jelipe: she is not even naked
11/13/16, 17:17:06: jelipe: she has this boring plastic body
11/13/16, 17:17:38: jelipe: im way more impressed with the art and vibe from 1984 or whenever it was made
11/13/16, 17:20:56: Morgan: Need to rewatch that classic
11/13/16, 17:22:28: AndreW: Its live action?
11/13/16, 17:22:33: jelipe: I watch it all the the time
11/13/16, 17:22:48: jelipe: and also the series is really great if you ignore the annoying tanks
11/13/16, 17:22:57: jelipe: yeah
11/13/16, 17:23:08: Morgan: Gonna watch both
11/13/16, 17:23:20: jelipe: well half of it, lots of computer animation
11/13/16, 17:23:36: Morgan: Is s.a.c. the main series
11/13/16, 17:24:21: AndreW: I read the graphNov in middle school but can barely remember anything from it
11/13/16, 17:25:11: jelipe: yeah
11/13/16, 17:25:24: jelipe: you never seen it?
11/13/16, 17:25:33: jelipe: i would say Excaliber is my favorite movie
11/13/16, 17:25:44: jelipe: amd Ghost in the Shell is my second
11/13/16, 17:28:08: AndreW: I saw the movie but also don't remember
11/13/16, 17:29:23: AndreW: I watched some of the SAC but those fujikomas were too annoying. Why did they give those cool spider tanks little kid voices? Don't they know that absolutely no one likes little kids?
11/13/16, 17:33:44: jelipe: yeah
11/13/16, 17:33:49: jelipe: its such a problem
11/13/16, 17:34:01: jelipe: but the series is really cool if you look past it
11/13/16, 17:34:14: jelipe: the movie has no annoying characters
11/13/16, 17:35:08: Morgan: Japanese entertainment in general has a high annoying kid tolerance
11/13/16, 17:36:02: jelipe: yeah
11/13/16, 17:36:12: jelipe: video games alot too
11/13/16, 17:36:21: Morgan: And if you assimilate to that and some other trope you will love all anime and become weeb
11/13/16, 17:36:31: jelipe: western games you are always a grown man
11/13/16, 17:36:40: jelipe: jap games is always a young boy
11/13/16, 17:36:46: Morgan: Tidus
11/13/16, 17:37:28: Morgan: Yeah I wonder if George Lucas saw that and made ep 1 anakin
11/13/16, 17:38:14: jelipe: i hope jar jar is in the new ghost in the shell movie
11/13/16, 17:38:52: Morgan: Yeah or at least some tachikomas
11/13/16, 17:39:21: Morgan: But they have the personalities of the black decepticon twins
11/13/16, 17:39:58: Morgan: Not sure if I'm remembering those right
11/13/16, 17:54:18: AndreW: Hahaha
11/13/16, 19:11:09: Kevin: <‎video omitted>
11/13/16, 19:13:08: AndreW: Hahahah
11/13/16, 19:13:10: jelipe: hahaha
11/13/16, 19:20:46: Morgan: Love that yak
11/13/16, 19:42:05: jelipe: is "under the skin" a good movie?
11/13/16, 19:43:25: AndreW: No
11/13/16, 19:45:06: jelipe: so your saying I should watch "The Rum Diary"?
11/13/16, 19:45:18: AndreW: No
11/13/16, 19:45:45: jelipe: I just got my grandmas netflix
11/13/16, 19:45:59: jelipe: need to watch something before westworld
11/13/16, 19:47:12: jelipe: what you guys think the policy in westwood is for childkilling?
11/13/16, 19:47:24: jelipe: how crazy are you allowed to be?
11/13/16, 19:48:05: jelipe: like how would the robots react if I wore a fat lady suit
11/13/16, 19:55:39: Morgan: Hahahaha
11/13/16, 19:57:46: Morgan: Read a lot of twitter takes that Westworld is unrealistic as a future scenario because people would already be bored with the Wild West and want furries, minions, sonic/Mario
11/13/16, 19:59:03: Harrison Reel: U can be as crazy as u want
11/13/16, 19:59:14: Morgan: Imagine seducing Mario into leaving sonic for you, and then when sonic shows up for revenge you kneecap him and cuck him again by taking his speed
11/13/16, 19:59:19: Harrison Reel: If u have the ca$h
11/13/16, 19:59:24: Morgan: That is the only rush that will sell in 2150
11/13/16, 19:59:29: Harrison Reel: Wait
11/13/16, 19:59:41: Harrison Reel: So in the future sega and ninendo are the same company?
11/13/16, 19:59:56: Morgan: No that is part of why their romance is so deep
11/13/16, 20:00:04: Harrison Reel: Thats beautiful
11/13/16, 20:00:06: Morgan: But also they are probably the same company by then
11/13/16, 20:00:11: Morgan: As is all of Japan
11/13/16, 20:29:35: jelipe: maybe there is a bunch of theme parks
11/13/16, 20:40:14: jelipe: well im watching final destination

11/14/16, 03:09:54: AndreW: Sting is perfectly cast in the Dune movie
11/14/16, 03:10:23: jelipe: yes
11/14/16, 03:10:25: jelipe: he is
11/14/16, 03:10:59: jelipe: out of the entire cast he is closest to my minds image
11/14/16, 03:11:57: AndreW: I only ever pictured these actors, but he stands out
11/14/16, 03:13:10: AndreW: This first harkonnen scene in the movie is really crazy
11/14/16, 03:16:04: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
11/14/16, 03:16:22: AndreW: With the Duke's hound
11/14/16, 03:24:03: Harrison Reel: That movie gets shit for being wayyy uncool bout gays/aids
11/14/16, 03:25:05: AndreW: What is the argument there?
11/14/16, 03:25:17: Harrison Reel: Forgot
11/14/16, 03:25:31: Harrison Reel: I think cause the gay guy is also a child molester
11/14/16, 03:25:43: Harrison Reel: Covered with grosd aids sores
11/14/16, 03:25:47: Harrison Reel: And also is evil
11/14/16, 03:25:59: Harrison Reel: But i forgot the deets
11/14/16, 03:26:38: AndreW: Are those supposed to be AIDS sores
11/14/16, 03:27:03: AndreW: Do AIDS people get sores?
11/14/16, 03:27:08: Harrison Reel: I doubt that was the intention
11/14/16, 03:27:21: Harrison Reel: But yes they do
11/14/16, 03:27:29: Harrison Reel: I think
11/14/16, 03:27:51: Harrison Reel: Basing this on family giy jokes amd a vague memory lf angels in America

11/14/16, 03:33:44: AndreW: I dunno if I'll read the next book
11/14/16, 03:34:35: AndreW: Dune 1 started to get too repetitive
11/14/16, 03:35:00: AndreW: All this talk about jihad and futures
11/14/16, 03:35:16: Harrison Reel: Ya dude
11/14/16, 03:35:22: Harrison Reel: I can dig it
11/14/16, 03:35:37: Harrison Reel: But look up the premise of god emperor of dune
11/14/16, 03:37:19: AndreW: OK that sounds pretty cool
11/14/16, 03:37:55: AndreW: But do you think you'd have to read dune 2 and 3 first?
11/14/16, 03:39:08: Harrison Reel: Hmmm
11/14/16, 03:39:13: Harrison Reel: I would guess yes
11/14/16, 03:39:21: Harrison Reel: Considering the way the first one is
11/14/16, 03:39:23: Harrison Reel: But
11/14/16, 03:39:28: Harrison Reel: Id be willing to take a chance
11/14/16, 03:39:33: Harrison Reel: And just skip over

11/14/16, 13:34:49: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
11/14/16, 14:16:29: jelipe: whaaaaaaatt

11/14/16, 14:23:43: Harrison Reel: No no no
11/14/16, 14:23:45: Harrison Reel: What happenee
11/14/16, 14:24:57: jelipe: well see andrew is probably rescuing everyone right now
11/14/16, 14:28:02: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
11/14/16, 14:28:34: AndreW: it happened at 9:30 am
11/14/16, 14:28:47: AndreW: so no one was there
11/14/16, 14:29:10: AndreW: except that country music station truck
11/14/16, 14:46:05: Morgan: Hahahaha
11/14/16, 14:46:18: Morgan: That's worth karma
11/14/16, 14:48:21: jelipe: r portlans
11/14/16, 14:56:46: AndreW: That's where I saw it
11/14/16, 15:15:48: Morgan: Ok I saw Westworld
11/14/16, 15:16:03: Morgan: Is everyone up to date
11/14/16, 15:28:42: Harrison Reel: Yes we were all waiting on you, lessgan
11/14/16, 15:29:08: Morgan: Ok I called Bernard
11/14/16, 15:29:37: jelipe: yes
11/14/16, 15:29:46: Morgan: I knew he was a host when they made a point of him being good at fuckin
11/14/16, 15:29:53: Harrison Reel: Dudr
11/14/16, 15:29:59: Harrison Reel: Thatcher is funny
11/14/16, 15:30:02: Harrison Reel: That*
11/14/16, 15:30:09: Morgan: You guys thought it was because he's black
11/14/16, 15:30:11: Harrison Reel: You gotta tweet that
11/14/16, 15:30:15: Morgan: Misdirection
11/14/16, 15:30:18: Harrison Reel: That too
11/14/16, 15:30:22: Harrison Reel: That too
11/14/16, 15:30:32: Harrison Reel: This is all twitter gold
11/14/16, 15:30:42: Harrison Reel: E separate tweets
11/14/16, 15:30:43: Harrison Reel: 3
11/14/16, 15:31:01: Morgan: Ok
11/14/16, 15:31:15: Harrison Reel: Who else
11/14/16, 15:31:18: Harrison Reel: Is a host tho
11/14/16, 15:31:26: Harrison Reel: Is everyone a host
11/14/16, 15:31:33: Harrison Reel: Who is def not a host
11/14/16, 15:31:52: Morgan: They're replacing the qa lady with a host copy of her
11/14/16, 15:32:11: Morgan: That's who they were 3D printing in the basement there
11/14/16, 15:32:59: Morgan: This was foreshadowed by Bernard asking to record her "cute when mad" expressions in like ep 1
11/14/16, 15:33:00: Harrison Reel: Daaaang
11/14/16, 15:33:17: Harrison Reel: At first i thought that was gon be the woman Bernard was bangin
11/14/16, 15:37:29: Morgan: So much "haha I won now I am safe from all harm" in that storyline
11/14/16, 15:40:17: AndreW: I'm confused about how human the host anatomy is. That clean up guy said hosts and humans were the same, but hosts can walk around with a bunch of bullet holes in them and only need a bucket of blood to recover after an injury
11/14/16, 15:40:44: jelipe: they are not the same
11/14/16, 15:40:51: jelipe: but they have blood
11/14/16, 15:41:02: jelipe: but its not so clear if they need the blood
11/14/16, 15:41:20: AndreW: Teddy needed the blood
11/14/16, 15:41:28: jelipe: could be a simple function if they dont have enough blood they die
11/14/16, 15:41:46: AndreW: He was at full life after the man in black gave him that dirty blood transfusion
11/14/16, 15:41:57: jelipe: hmmmm
11/14/16, 15:42:19: jelipe: they need it but perhaps it is not blood in that it provide the body with oxygen
11/14/16, 15:53:15: Morgan: They probably just have Cylon disease resistance
11/14/16, 15:53:25: Morgan: And all the same blood type
11/14/16, 15:53:40: Morgan: And loose writing
11/14/16, 15:55:13: Morgan: QA lady and Bernard will continue to bang after they are both hosts
11/14/16, 15:56:29: AndreW: They weren't banging before were they?
11/14/16, 15:56:48: Morgan: Yeah they stopped
11/14/16, 15:57:04: Morgan: But the Cylon horniness will kick in and they will get back together
11/14/16, 15:57:23: AndreW: Oh you mean that corporate woman. I was thinking QA was that girl who went missing last week
11/14/16, 15:57:32: Morgan: She's behavior
11/14/16, 15:57:41: Morgan: I like her
11/14/16, 15:57:54: Morgan: I was waiting for her scene all ep
11/14/16, 15:58:02: Morgan: People have no sense of danger in this show
11/14/16, 15:58:32: AndreW: Yeah
11/14/16, 15:58:38: Morgan: "Oh this room is a facility used by my enemies, I will stay here to use the wifi for a while"
11/14/16, 15:58:50: jelipe: wait the lady is a host too?
11/14/16, 15:58:55: jelipe: not just bernard?
11/14/16, 15:59:03: Morgan: She's being printed right now I think
11/14/16, 15:59:06: Morgan: Fan theory
11/14/16, 15:59:11: jelipe: ohhhhhhh
11/14/16, 15:59:11: Morgan: Straight from this fan
11/14/16, 15:59:17: jelipe: ahhahahah
11/14/16, 16:00:42: AndreW: I would lose my danger  sense too after working there a few years. Hosts can't hurt humans
11/14/16, 16:00:42: Morgan: They are gonna restart their bang sessions once they are both hosts
11/14/16, 16:00:54: Morgan: And that unpredicted interaction will set them free
11/14/16, 16:01:10: Morgan: Maybe the hotshot gun guy is a host
11/14/16, 16:01:18: Morgan: since he is still afraid of them
11/14/16, 16:02:53: Morgan: But back to Bernard and Theresa
11/14/16, 16:03:39: Morgan: Their relationship leading to some kind of liberation fits with Fords speech this  ep
11/14/16, 16:03:59: Morgan: Basest desires producing conscious and all of its advancements
11/14/16, 16:04:57: Morgan: They are gonna be banging, and then one of them will just start solving Rubik's cubes in seconds
11/14/16, 16:05:20: Morgan: And like doing algebra faster and faster until climax
11/14/16, 16:05:30: Morgan: And then ford is in trouble
11/14/16, 16:08:17: jelipe: hahaha
11/14/16, 16:08:36: jelipe: i wad hoping there was going to be a big uprising
11/14/16, 16:08:56: jelipe: and then all the hosts run to like phoenix arizona naked
11/14/16, 16:09:03: jelipe: and start causing mayhem
11/14/16, 16:09:14: jelipe: tearing up the walgreens
11/14/16, 16:09:14: Morgan: Hahaha
11/14/16, 16:09:23: Morgan: That would be really good
11/14/16, 16:09:37: jelipe: isnt that what all of this is buildig up to?
11/14/16, 16:10:56: Harrison Reel: What does the edge of the park look like

11/14/16, 16:18:23: jelipe: a boring bestiality story
11/14/16, 16:19:54: Morgan: They are just trying to make more furries because furries spend more money
11/14/16, 16:22:27: AndreW: When I got my haircut the woman said I looked like beast after he turned back into a man. She got a big tip
11/14/16, 16:24:15: Harrison Reel: Just the tip?
11/14/16, 16:24:27: Harrison Reel: Man i bet even andrews tip is big

11/14/16, 17:02:05: jelipe: show off your tolerance necklace for the secret menu
11/14/16, 17:06:41: Morgan: My mind parsed that as like a proof of no shellfish allergy
11/14/16, 17:06:56: Harrison Reel: What
11/14/16, 17:07:45: Morgan: Like if you have shellfish intolerance you might have a medical bracelet
11/14/16, 17:07:55: Morgan: This is the opposite
11/14/16, 17:08:09: Morgan: You can tolerate very excessive amounts of it
11/14/16, 17:08:35: Harrison Reel: Ohhhhh

11/21/16, 16:48:00: jelipe: its like they dig a hole in the ground a cook a whole sheep or something
11/21/16, 16:53:28: jelipe: its good but no global scale hamburger factory
11/21/16, 16:53:45: jelipe: u guys see WW yet?
11/21/16, 16:55:05: jelipe: its got woody harrelsons true detective gf
11/21/16, 16:55:24: AndreW: i saw it
11/21/16, 16:56:00: AndreW: feels like that show has been 1 sentence away explaining everything for too long now
11/21/16, 16:56:45: jelipe: coulda been 3 eps
11/21/16, 16:57:01: AndreW: and those chop shop techs are sooo stupid
11/21/16, 16:57:22: AndreW: maeve is cool for tricking them, but they are retards
11/21/16, 16:57:59: Morgan: She doesn't even trick them
11/21/16, 16:58:31: Morgan: She just sits there and shows that she is very clever charismatic deadly and then they have to do what she says
11/21/16, 16:58:51: Morgan: They skip the part where she actually traps them
11/21/16, 16:59:01: jelipe: watching now, just tell me this, they break out and run into s walgreens in this one?
11/21/16, 16:59:11: AndreW: yeah
11/21/16, 16:59:24: AndreW: at least we find out what happened to that girl in behaviour
11/21/16, 16:59:36: AndreW: in like a 2 second shot
11/21/16, 16:59:38: Morgan: Lmao
11/21/16, 16:59:47: Morgan: I missed that
11/21/16, 17:00:00: jelipe: you think there is a deeper secret
11/21/16, 17:00:22: jelipe: like they are actually a colony ship
11/21/16, 17:00:36: jelipe: because earth was destroyed
11/21/16, 17:00:51: AndreW: it could be literally anything and none of it would be satisfying
11/21/16, 17:01:06: jelipe: ape attack?
11/21/16, 17:01:07: Morgan: I liked the "I'm evil cause my wife hate me" speech we finally got from a certain musters character
11/21/16, 17:01:28: AndreW: hahaha
11/21/16, 17:02:39: AndreW: i wish they explained more clearly how much the hosts are able to hurt the guests. Most of the time im just wondering whether the hosts are malfunctioning or not
11/21/16, 17:03:15: jelipe: yeah and they seem to human sometimes and othertimes like robots
11/21/16, 17:03:53: AndreW: the big internet theory right now is that the nice guy guest is the same as the man in black guest
11/21/16, 17:03:56: jelipe: also it would be cooler if they died like the androids in Alien
11/21/16, 17:04:09: AndreW: hahaha
11/21/16, 17:04:25: jelipe: like weird inhuman scream while they flail around
11/21/16, 17:04:49: AndreW: yeah, just like in the old west
11/21/16, 17:04:56: jelipe: hahahah
11/21/16, 17:05:15: jelipe: yeah these techs are really dumb
11/21/16, 17:05:24: jelipe: how much u think they get paid
11/21/16, 17:05:50: AndreW: probably future minimum wage of $50/hour
11/21/16, 17:06:04: jelipe: "listen sweetheart, your not getting out of here"
11/21/16, 17:06:37: AndreW: i dont see why that guy won't just tell his boss they have a malfunctioning robot
11/21/16, 17:07:12: jelipe: come on andreew
11/21/16, 17:07:20: jelipe: they dont wanna lose their jobs
11/21/16, 17:07:48: jelipe: also wasnt that guy boning them
11/21/16, 17:08:09: AndreW: i guess she has some necro sex thing on him, but seems like all the tech are having sex with them
11/21/16, 17:08:18: jelipe: like when the indians scalp one of the mannequins he would fuck them in the lab
11/21/16, 17:08:44: jelipe: those things probably weigh like 900lbs
11/21/16, 17:09:13: jelipe: it would be cool of they were smokers, and this was like a pineapple express type movie
11/21/16, 17:09:23: AndreW: i dunno, they seem like 100% organic machines
11/21/16, 17:09:50: jelipe: we still dont know their physiology
11/21/16, 17:10:12: AndreW: only the old ones are made of metal
11/21/16, 17:10:44: jelipe: awe sick
11/21/16, 17:10:49: jelipe: new minatuar
11/21/16, 17:11:38: AndreW: kinda lame that there was a minotaur guarding the maz
11/21/16, 17:11:51: jelipe: hahahaha
11/21/16, 17:12:23: jelipe: ehat woulda been better
11/21/16, 17:12:25: jelipe: greys?
11/21/16, 17:13:46: AndreW: ford should have introduced some scifi elements to his westworld

12/1/16, 13:19:32: AndreW: And some sort of G Man

12/1/16, 13:28:44: AndreW: But it was his countrymen who turned on him
12/1/16, 13:30:28: Harrison Reel: Just like irl
12/1/16, 13:31:16: AndreW: And he has a stoner nephew living in his ranch house

12/1/16, 14:13:13: Harrison Reel: Wish i coulda worked a shift w him
12/1/16, 14:13:18: AndreW: Phil did the holtzman vanish
12/1/16, 14:13:19: Harrison Reel: Andrew what was phil like
12/1/16, 14:13:23: Harrison Reel: As a reel employee
12/1/16, 14:13:30: AndreW: He was before all our times
12/1/16, 14:13:40: Harrison Reel: Whoaaaaa
12/1/16, 14:13:45: Harrison Reel: He was the og
12/1/16, 14:13:52: Harrison Reel: Good for him
12/1/16, 14:14:00: Harrison Reel: Holtzman varnish
12/1/16, 14:14:07: Harrison Reel: Americas most trusted brand
12/1/16, 14:14:11: Morgan: Back when reel was a vampire-only business
12/1/16, 14:14:13: Harrison Reel: On sale at OSH
12/1/16, 14:14:25: Morgan: Or wait I have that wrong
12/1/16, 14:14:29: AndreW: Haha

12/1/16, 14:15:04: Harrison Reel: And im all out of bubble gum
12/1/16, 14:15:15: AndreW: Was Tuttle pre Morgan?
12/1/16, 14:15:17: Morgan: What did he do? Like blow rails with young Kevin in the back, teachin him the biz
12/1/16, 14:15:29: AndreW: That's my understanding
12/1/16, 14:15:31: Morgan: Yes
12/1/16, 14:15:53: Harrison Reel: I was promoted like a week before kevin
12/1/16, 14:15:59: Harrison Reel: Juat so everyone knows
12/1/16, 14:16:02: Harrison Reel: Fyi
12/1/16, 14:16:19: Morgan: They passed over Andrew I remember
12/1/16, 14:16:26: Morgan: He had seniority but was too nice
12/1/16, 14:16:29: Harrison Reel: Andrew was not mgmt material
12/1/16, 14:16:34: AndreW: Promoted to shift lead or to store director?
12/1/16, 14:16:49: Harrison Reel: He had the weekends crossed off on his availavility for gods sake
12/1/16, 14:16:52: Harrison Reel: Not a team player
12/1/16, 14:16:52: Morgan: He could not discipline Gavin and Jenny when it came time
12/1/16, 14:17:02: AndreW: I made that mistake of being irreplaceable in my job
12/1/16, 14:17:15: Morgan: They would be out front smoking all shift in an Andrew regime
12/1/16, 14:17:30: Harrison Reel: In an androcracy
12/1/16, 14:17:34: AndreW: They couldn't promote me because no one else could handle it
12/1/16, 14:18:12: Morgan: I remember Kevin had to come out and yell at us one time, on one of the ~10 smoke breaks I took while working there
12/1/16, 14:18:25: Morgan: "I am the only one in the store"
12/1/16, 14:18:47: Morgan: I looked around at the like 5 people and went oh dam he's right
12/1/16, 14:19:06: AndreW: I only crossed off nights and weekends after I got passed over
12/1/16, 14:19:17: Harrison Reel: Is that true
12/1/16, 14:19:20: Harrison Reel: I didnt know that
12/1/16, 14:19:25: AndreW: One of the times
12/1/16, 14:19:26: Harrison Reel: Kinda dont believe u
12/1/16, 14:19:28: Morgan: I was forced to take on weekends when I was promoted here
12/1/16, 14:19:49: Morgan: This ends today
12/1/16, 14:19:58: Harrison Reel: Dude juat walk out

12/1/16, 14:20:11: Morgan: I want their cash
12/1/16, 14:20:14: AndreW: And sell the stuff
12/1/16, 14:20:17: Harrison Reel: Take it
12/1/16, 14:20:56: Morgan: Yeah I can't steal so I am not morally ok with continuing to work for this company
12/1/16, 14:21:05: Morgan: Maybe under a Hillary presidency
12/1/16, 14:21:57: Morgan: Heard manager say trump had made "no bad picks so far" for his shitshow cabinet lol
12/1/16, 14:28:53: AndreW: Hahaha
12/1/16, 14:29:08: AndreW: What jobs are you thinking about?
12/1/16, 14:29:16: AndreW: You have any irons in the fire?
12/1/16, 14:29:39: Morgan: Shrug emoji
12/1/16, 14:29:42: AndreW: Can't you keep working for Jonas?
12/1/16, 14:30:18: Morgan: Nahhh it's been over a year
12/1/16, 14:30:38: Morgan: More like 2.5 really since substantial stuff
12/1/16, 14:30:41: AndreW: Or get a job with that? Seems like that would look good on you cv
12/1/16, 14:31:24: Morgan: Yes
12/1/16, 14:31:57: Morgan: I need to disengage from this place right now though I think
12/1/16, 14:32:09: Harrison Reel: Morgan if u want to tutor ill give ur name to the test prep company i get work from
12/1/16, 14:32:31: Morgan: Is that a good gig?
12/1/16, 14:32:35: Morgan: Quick pitch?
12/1/16, 14:33:36: Harrison Reel: Its always done good by me
12/1/16, 14:33:46: Harrison Reel: At first its slow
12/1/16, 14:33:50: Morgan: Is it easy to start/stop?
12/1/16, 14:33:55: Harrison Reel: Ya
12/1/16, 14:34:01: Morgan: Because that would be perf
12/1/16, 14:34:07: Harrison Reel: Its chill
12/1/16, 14:34:15: Morgan: I will be going out of town for a week or two this month
12/1/16, 14:38:52: Morgan: Do you usually picture yourself as one of Paul Atriedes' teachers
12/1/16, 14:39:28: Morgan: Don't sit with your back to the door Colbton
12/1/16, 14:39:48: Morgan: And remember soh cah toa
12/1/16, 14:46:56: Harrison Reel: P much

12/1/16, 14:47:11: Harrison Reel: But it comes up
12/1/16, 14:47:33: Harrison Reel: Most of the trig questions they encounter are just like do u member sohcahtoa
12/1/16, 14:58:35: AndreW: And then your wise student says "I knew it was you by your breathing and foot pattern, Gibson"
12/1/16, 15:01:19: AndreW: Wise ass student*
12/1/16, 16:42:50: Harrison Reel: Just watched an american dad where stan gets a new ape body because he wants to be ready for the impending ape uprising
12/1/16, 16:42:54: Harrison Reel: Felt relevant
12/1/16, 16:43:53: Harrison Reel: Im bout to tutor for 4.5 hrs straight
12/1/16, 16:44:01: Harrison Reel: Thats the biz tho
12/1/16, 16:44:23: AndreW: Working  for that long sounds exhausting
12/1/16, 16:44:42: Harrison Reel: Ya its a drag
12/1/16, 16:44:52: Harrison Reel: But thats uncommon
12/1/16, 16:45:09: Harrison Reel: And i have plenty o days on which i dont work at all
12/1/16, 16:45:17: Harrison Reel: Its a net chill increase
12/1/16, 16:46:38: AndreW: What's the pay on something like that?
12/1/16, 16:48:47: Harrison Reel: Diff students have diff rates depending on which company im getting them through or whether im getting then direct
12/1/16, 16:48:59: Harrison Reel: For these students today itll be 195
12/1/16, 16:49:41: AndreW: That's pretty nice. How many days a week usually?
12/1/16, 16:50:54: Harrison Reel: It changes all the time. All depends on students schedules/preferences. I try to keep it at a few days a week but ive been in phases where i worked every day. And in some where i worked 0-1 days a week.
12/1/16, 16:51:07: Harrison Reel: This is a p slow period im in atm so its 1-2 days a week
12/1/16, 16:51:12: Harrison Reel: But it changes

12/1/16, 16:52:27: AndreW: The call to action. That's the first step of the hero's journey
12/1/16, 16:52:55: Harrison Reel: Ya man my aunt and uncles burning corpses are sizzilin beneath the twain suns
12/1/16, 16:53:03: Harrison Reel: Theres nothing for me here now
12/1/16, 16:53:05: AndreW: Hahaha
12/1/16, 16:53:29: AndreW: But you accepted the call, so maybe you aren't the hero of this story
12/1/16, 16:54:16: Harrison Reel: Damn

12/1/16, 16:55:04: Harrison Reel: Its just weird
12/1/16, 16:55:08: AndreW: Yeah. Little racist for you to assume

12/1/16, 16:56:24: Harrison Reel: So whos got their rogue one ticks
12/1/16, 16:56:31: AndreW: Just because all rodians dress the same and look the same doesn't mean they are the same
12/1/16, 16:56:39: Harrison Reel: And act the same
12/1/16, 16:56:48: Harrison Reel: And have the same job
12/1/16, 16:56:57: AndreW: Im excited for the prequel
12/1/16, 16:57:14: AndreW: But it doesn't feel like star wars season last year

12/1/16, 20:01:14: AndreW: He's not home
12/1/16, 20:01:36: AndreW: He's driving his gf to school
12/1/16, 20:02:00: jelipe: perfect time for pizza
12/1/16, 20:02:22: jelipe: I wanna get one one but my roommate is drunk eating saltines in the living room
12/1/16, 20:02:29: jelipe: (serious)
12/1/16, 20:02:56: AndreW: This sounds more like your soulmate
12/1/16, 20:03:05: jelipe: hahah
12/1/16, 20:03:54: jelipe: my soulmate is actually the hot girl that works at dominos who has crushes on fat guys
12/1/16, 20:04:04: AndreW: Hahaha
12/1/16, 20:04:17: jelipe: but can never find one because she is too busy playing rogulikes
12/1/16, 20:05:40: AndreW: You'll have to go to domino's every day, during every shift, until you meet her
12/1/16, 20:06:48: jelipe: did u get it delivered

12/1/16, 20:07:09: jelipe: how can I disguise the pizza and walk straight to my room?
12/1/16, 20:07:20: jelipe: like pretend its something else
12/1/16, 20:07:42: jelipe: what else is the same shape of a large pizza box
12/1/16, 20:10:49: AndreW: Laptop box? Just going to your room with a hot and steamy laptop
12/1/16, 20:11:12: jelipe: my laptop bag is too small
12/1/16, 20:11:47: AndreW: Is there really an expectation to share?
12/1/16, 20:12:04: jelipe: no but he will turn around drunk
12/1/16, 20:12:24: jelipe: look at me and go "ayy tienes pizza, que chido..."
12/1/16, 20:12:42: jelipe: and for some reason I dont want that to happen
12/1/16, 20:14:35: jelipe: he is going to want me to hang out in the kitchen sharing it
12/1/16, 20:14:44: jelipe: and he will offer me beer
12/1/16, 20:14:53: jelipe: dont want to interact
12/1/16, 20:15:26: jelipe: he will think it very unfriendly if I dont release him a slice
12/1/16, 20:17:33: AndreW: OK here's the plan
12/1/16, 20:18:30: jelipe: ok
12/1/16, 20:18:44: AndreW: Go to burger king. Get a whopper to go. Eat it, but save the bag. When you get the pizza, remove it from box and separate the  slices. Stack them up in the bk bag
12/1/16, 20:18:58: jelipe: hahahahahahaha

12/1/16, 21:17:23: jelipe: i ate it, seems arright, my exgf was really tripped out I would put ketchup on my eggs
12/1/16, 21:17:33: jelipe: which is not really that much better
12/1/16, 21:17:52: jelipe: or when I would shave with it in the shower
12/1/16, 21:21:38: AndreW: Hahaha
12/1/16, 21:22:13: AndreW: Or you'd put it in her b.h. before eating that too

12/3/16, 01:05:23: AndreW: What happened?
12/3/16, 01:07:41: Harrison Reel: Got a drink
12/3/16, 01:08:03: Harrison Reel: She was "jet lagged" and "really tired" so she called it early.
12/3/16, 01:08:23: Harrison Reel: But if she had been feelin it that wouldn't have mattered, right?
12/3/16, 01:09:46: AndreW: How long did it last? 1 drink?
12/3/16, 01:10:09: AndreW: Was it fun until she left?
12/3/16, 01:10:09: Harrison Reel: 1 drink
12/3/16, 01:10:12: Harrison Reel: 2 hours
12/3/16, 01:10:58: Harrison Reel: It wasnt great but she was so god damned tired and kept talking about how tired she was so that kinda was a thing
12/3/16, 01:12:08: AndreW: Maybe she was tired. But there are a lot of things that can ruin a first date. Like you discovering how annoying she is when she's tired
12/3/16, 01:12:54: Harrison Reel: Totally.
12/3/16, 01:13:00: Harrison Reel: Oh boy.
12/3/16, 01:13:07: Harrison Reel: Such a let down.

12/3/16, 01:32:44: AndreW: like a little sip and then you make a grossed out face
12/3/16, 01:32:52: jelipe: hahaha

12/3/16, 17:37:11: jelipe: +intimidating
12/3/16, 17:38:08: Morgan: Good armor vs energy weapons
12/3/16, 17:38:30: jelipe: except the belly
12/3/16, 17:38:44: jelipe: right where anyone can stand under it
12/3/16, 17:39:00: jelipe: it should really have guns under and on the sides
12/3/16, 17:39:03: jelipe: also back
12/3/16, 17:39:07: jelipe: for as big as it is
12/3/16, 17:39:18: jelipe: i can only shoot directly infront of it
12/3/16, 17:39:34: jelipe: it*
12/3/16, 17:39:53: Morgan: It should just be a UFO but Star Wars needs every unit to have a WWII analogue
12/3/16, 17:41:21: jelipe: like its a german walker?
12/3/16, 17:43:10: jelipe: the empire should decomission them and set them up as restaurants
12/3/16, 17:43:25: jelipe: w craft beer
12/3/16, 17:43:32: jelipe: and 12 credit burgers
12/3/16, 17:49:14: AndreW: Yeah, at at is dumb
12/3/16, 17:49:23: AndreW: why only head guns?
12/3/16, 17:49:34: AndreW: the clone trooper proto at at looked more functional
12/3/16, 17:50:06: AndreW: since it had more guns
12/3/16, 17:50:33: AndreW: but everything else hovers
12/3/16, 17:50:57: AndreW: did we ever see what was in the AT AT in the movies?
12/3/16, 17:51:02: jelipe: I hope there is lots of B-wings in the new sw
12/3/16, 17:51:23: jelipe: i remember someone like shot a grapping hook
12/3/16, 17:51:32: jelipe: and lightsabered the belly
12/3/16, 17:51:46: jelipe: i think that was Lando Kardashian
12/3/16, 17:52:25: AndreW: i think that' weakness is fine. there were only like 3 light sabers in the entire universe at that point. was pretty unlikely to happen
12/3/16, 17:53:01: jelipe: hahahaha
12/3/16, 17:53:12: AndreW: looking at the list of Rogue One toys, there is something called a U-Wing
12/3/16, 17:53:18: jelipe: would be cool of the hoth storm troopers walked atound with wampas on chains
12/3/16, 17:53:21: jelipe: in chains
12/3/16, 17:53:21: AndreW: and an imperial assault hovertank
12/3/16, 17:53:27: jelipe: to release them on rebels
12/3/16, 17:53:36: AndreW: hahah
12/3/16, 17:54:19: jelipe: where the P-Wing at?
12/3/16, 17:54:18: AndreW: remember that deleted scene where the 3PO switches the sign for the wampa room in the rebel base and those snow troopers go in there by accident?
12/3/16, 17:54:29: AndreW: or my D-Wing
12/3/16, 17:55:40: AndreW: https://youtu.be/nX0CDwZJe-s
12/3/16, 22:36:22: jelipe: man that is a really lame scene
12/3/16, 22:37:58: Morgan: Humor was different back then
12/3/16, 22:38:02: Morgan: Worse
12/3/16, 22:38:51: Morgan: Like Monty python was groundbreakingly great and it kind of sucks right?
12/3/16, 22:38:58: jelipe: ihavent seen any star wars classic movies
12/3/16, 22:39:11: jelipe: in like 15 years at least
12/3/16, 22:39:22: Morgan: That can't be true
12/3/16, 22:39:23: jelipe: yeah it sucks now
12/3/16, 22:39:28: AndreW: I was never a Monty python fan
12/3/16, 22:39:37: Morgan: Harrison get in here and freak out at him
12/3/16, 22:39:42: jelipe: i liked "the meaning of life"
12/3/16, 22:40:05: jelipe: i didnt like the holy grail, at all, ever
12/3/16, 22:40:13: jelipe: except a few scenes
12/3/16, 22:40:22: jelipe: ut that was also 20 years ago
12/3/16, 22:41:30: jelipe: but for real I saw star wars trilogy like in 1992, then again when i was gifted it on vhs in the late 90s
12/3/16, 22:41:50: jelipe: and then i saw the new star warses years later
12/3/16, 22:42:14: jelipe: I did read several novels by them in between, Tales from the Cantina
12/3/16, 22:42:28: jelipe: also one about the bounty hunters
12/3/16, 22:42:42: Morgan: I read like 10 sw books but I barely member any of them
12/3/16, 22:43:05: jelipe: but yeah, i have not seen the trilogy in like at least 17 years
12/3/16, 22:43:15: jelipe: i remember enjoying alot of the books
12/3/16, 22:43:25: Morgan: There is one where they are on a parasitic bug planet and they like let the bugs burrow into their arms so their bodies can get nutrients from them
12/3/16, 22:43:29: jelipe: i remember loving the universe and it making sense
12/3/16, 22:43:48: jelipe: i remember one about a star destroyer captain
12/3/16, 22:44:05: jelipe: but i mostly kept to the short stories
12/3/16, 22:44:07: Morgan: And the bad guy is a bug that a galactic master chef kept alive beyond his natural lifespan in an attempt to create the ultimate delicacy
12/3/16, 22:44:22: jelipe: and yeah i dont remember any of it
12/3/16, 22:44:27: jelipe: ahhahahah
12/3/16, 22:44:20: Morgan: But he became sentient and humanoid instead
12/3/16, 22:44:21: Morgan: And bad
12/3/16, 22:44:29: Morgan: And maybe force sensitive?
12/3/16, 22:44:46: jelipe: did you guys play all the LucasArts games?
12/3/16, 22:44:55: jelipe: rebel assault
12/3/16, 22:45:09: Morgan: I played dark forces at a friends house once and it kicked ass
12/3/16, 22:47:01: Morgan: I think there was a whole series about a guy named Dash Rendar
12/3/16, 22:47:06: jelipe: uhhhh
12/3/16, 22:47:16: jelipe: i made my own gob files in Dark Forces
12/3/16, 22:47:26: jelipe: yeah
12/3/16, 22:47:35: Morgan: What is gob
12/3/16, 22:47:41: jelipe: That was probably one of the best FPS of all time
12/3/16, 22:47:45: jelipe: level files
12/3/16, 22:47:44: AndreW: Dash rendar was the guy from the n64 game shadows of the empire
12/3/16, 22:48:04: jelipe: i was playing that like 2 weeks ago
12/3/16, 22:48:14: jelipe: i blasted through hoth
12/3/16, 22:48:28: jelipe: that was a hard game for me actually
12/3/16, 22:48:43: jelipe: but for real Dark Forces was such a great game
12/3/16, 22:48:43: AndreW: Did you go in the wampa room?
12/3/16, 22:48:53: AndreW: The wampas are invincible
12/3/16, 22:49:12: jelipe: yeH, thats where you get the homing ammo to kill the atst later on
12/3/16, 22:49:17: jelipe: they are not
12/3/16, 22:49:23: jelipe: and they are hellla slow
12/3/16, 22:49:31: AndreW: Shadows of the empire had some cool cheats where you couple play as them or the show troopers
12/3/16, 22:49:43: AndreW: You can't kill em though
12/3/16, 22:49:46: jelipe: you just open them and shoot them for 1.5 minutes
12/3/16, 22:49:57: AndreW: Hahah

12/5/16, 15:26:20: AndreW: i was hoping for a serious mummy treatment
12/5/16, 15:27:43: jelipe: yeah she looks like the kind of run of the mill female mummy heroine young women could look up to
12/5/16, 15:30:48: AndreW: hahaha
12/5/16, 15:31:01: AndreW: more like normal screaming ghost girl
12/5/16, 15:31:07: jelipe: hahahaha
12/5/16, 15:31:17: jelipe: I can definately see young women looking up to her though
12/5/16, 15:31:30: jelipe: def the most beautiful mummy I have seen
12/5/16, 15:31:30: AndreW: should be more like Aaliyah in queen of the damned
12/5/16, 15:31:47: AndreW: or that Incan Mummy Girl in buffy
12/5/16, 15:31:53: jelipe: hahahah
12/5/16, 15:32:29: jelipe: well I think we all know it should be a cis-male rotting mummy barely able to move animated by a magical curse
12/5/16, 15:32:59: jelipe: but cuz all you guys had to see new ghostbusters twice in theatres we dont get that
12/5/16, 15:33:02: AndreW: hahha

12/5/16, 17:53:50: Harrison Reel: That elevator was sealed off from securitys reach
12/5/16, 17:53:54: Harrison Reel: For security reasons
12/5/16, 17:54:02: AndreW: Doesn't sound very secure
12/5/16, 17:54:03: Morgan: Maive couldn't go to freedom because she is a fembot with mom programming

12/5/16, 17:55:08: Harrison Reel: That got me
12/5/16, 17:55:22: AndreW: I figured it out in the recap
12/5/16, 17:55:32: Morgan: Yeah it's kind of different that someone wrote the steps in explicitly
12/5/16, 17:55:45: Morgan: but we knew they were all being primed for it anyway
12/5/16, 17:55:45: Harrison Reel: I was vapin during the recap
12/5/16, 17:55:49: Harrison Reel: Like usual
12/5/16, 17:55:51: Morgan: wonder who that was

12/5/16, 17:58:23: Harrison Reel: Me and morgan usually watch westworld w this chick
12/5/16, 17:58:33: Harrison Reel: She has a lot of good theories
12/5/16, 17:58:35: Harrison Reel: <‎image omitted>
12/5/16, 17:58:46: Morgan: and they concluded it by just having the mib say "heh i knew a fella named william, some would say, that fella was me haha"

12/5/16, 17:59:17: Harrison Reel: I was nvr into the theory that he was the other guy

12/5/16, 17:59:28: Harrison Reel: And was disappointed it was
12/5/16, 17:59:45: Morgan: did logan get a sunburn from riding that horse naked
12/5/16, 17:59:48: AndreW: Yeah. I agree with the time thing

12/5/16, 18:00:28: Harrison Reel: Good question
12/5/16, 18:00:31: Morgan: logan was pretty chill about it
12/5/16, 18:00:34: Harrison Reel: And when did they brush their teeth
12/5/16, 18:00:41: AndreW: Yeah. That's his thing I guess
12/5/16, 18:00:54: Morgan: why didn't teddy give dolores his magic blood to bring her back
12/5/16, 18:01:11: Harrison Reel: Thats a two man job
12/5/16, 18:01:16: Harrison Reel: Like brake fluid
12/5/16, 18:01:25: Harrison Reel: Its actually a lot like a brake fluid job
12/5/16, 18:01:34: Harrison Reel: U need one guy to apply the brakes
12/5/16, 18:01:35: Morgan: hahaha

12/5/16, 18:03:38: Harrison Reel: That maze stuff wasnt cool
12/5/16, 18:03:50: AndreW: I thought the real revelation was that that painting was a brain

12/5/16, 18:10:51: AndreW: You think Bernard is thinking, "why did you make me a fat old guy? Couldn't you make me young buff Bernard?"
12/5/16, 18:11:12: Harrison Reel: But then he wydnt have the full cornerstone
12/5/16, 18:11:23: Harrison Reel: Ya gotta have the sadness bro

12/5/16, 23:47:27: jelipe: of the outback
12/5/16, 23:50:04: jelipe: "In addition to the film's atmosphere of sordid realism, the kangaroo hunting scene contains graphic footage of kangaroos actually being shot."
12/5/16, 23:50:24: Morgan: Damn
12/5/16, 23:50:30: Harrison Reel: That trailer is dope
12/5/16, 23:50:37: Harrison Reel: Yall are becoming some old ass men
12/5/16, 23:50:41: jelipe: "According to cinematographer Brian West, "the hunters were getting really drunk and they started to miss, ... It was becoming this orgy of killing and we [the crew] were getting sick of it." Kangaroos hopped about helplessly with gun wounds and trailing intestines. "

I told my brother about it and he started to butcher the replacement pug while it was still alive, but the dog didn't seem to mind very much
12/6/16, 10:33:18: jelipe: i just woke up too!

12/6/16, 14:25:17: AndreW: those nude models never have boners
12/6/16, 14:25:30: AndreW: for some reason
12/6/16, 14:27:10: Harrison Reel: Dude u couldnt sustain ur boner that time me and my camera amd lighting crew were there
12/6/16, 14:27:15: Harrison Reel: Dont front

12/6/16, 14:41:05: jelipe: hahaha
12/6/16, 14:47:07: jelipe: I know harrisons favorite part is the Frank Sinatra - My Way cover

12/6/16, 14:50:24: jelipe: i dont like how slow everyone talks
12/6/16, 14:50:47: jelipe: I didnt care about any of the people who died
12/6/16, 14:51:22: jelipe: and I hate dream sequences if you dont know if somethings ~real~ or not
12/6/16, 14:51:36: jelipe: _real_ or not
12/6/16, 14:52:02: jelipe: I got more satisfaction out of that kangaroo choking out the dog video
12/6/16, 14:52:30: Harrison Reel: That was a p dope vid

12/6/16, 14:53:18: AndreW: That brain painting hidden in the Sistine chapel was the coolest part for me
12/6/16, 14:53:26: jelipe: i didnt get any of that good feeling when anthony hopkins crashed the dinner party w bots
12/6/16, 14:54:00: jelipe: I was more interested in Tom Cruise Mummy Trailer before Mummy was revealed

12/6/16, 14:54:18: Harrison Reel: I havent watched thw trailer yet tho
12/6/16, 14:54:40: AndreW: After that last episode i feel like the hosts are less human than ever and Ford is just being a jerk for suiciding and setting a bunch of killbots loose
12/6/16, 14:54:45: ‎You changed the subject to “Goody Goody..”
12/6/16, 14:54:53: AndreW: Hahaha
12/6/16, 14:54:57: jelipe: yeah
12/6/16, 14:55:03: jelipe: why did he even do that
12/6/16, 14:55:13: jelipe: "cuz they are suffering?"

12/6/16, 14:55:50: Harrison Reel: So good
12/6/16, 14:55:53: AndreW: Because I guess he finally decided that he was wrong for keeping the hosts down for 30 years so he programmed them to kill
12/6/16, 14:56:02: AndreW: That is a good movie
12/6/16, 14:56:05: Harrison Reel: Ww def took a lot from the island

12/6/16, 15:01:35: Morgan: Italo is being unfairly represented as gay rape music
12/6/16, 15:01:39: jelipe: i like when they make rapists or sexual deviants laugh at what they are about to do in movies

12/6/16, 15:02:49: jelipe: no wonder the asian guy has no real personality and all he does is mostly gasp or look alarmed
12/6/16, 15:03:11: jelipe: he probably has to watch that guy do his thing all the time
12/6/16, 15:03:12: Morgan: He's a terrible human
12/6/16, 15:03:19: Morgan: Yeah that is a good point

12/6/16, 16:25:50: Harrison Reel: Not a decade
12/6/16, 16:25:58: Harrison Reel: But nearly 8 years
12/6/16, 16:26:04: Harrison Reel: So my point stands
12/6/16, 16:26:05: Morgan: are any of the cohen bros movies about getting to close to the zohar
12/6/16, 16:26:07: Harrison Reel: Proud
12/6/16, 16:26:18: Harrison Reel: A serious man mightve been

12/6/16, 16:29:54: Harrison Reel: A little accuracy is always appreciated
12/6/16, 16:30:09: Harrison Reel: Didja see the last few

12/6/16, 16:31:04: Harrison Reel: As would any of us
12/6/16, 16:31:12: Harrison Reel: We are only human men
12/6/16, 16:31:21: Harrison Reel: What flavor is that
12/6/16, 16:31:29: jelipe: hail caesar wasnt too bad, i like the gay actor
12/6/16, 16:31:34: AndreW: Apple?
12/6/16, 16:31:50: Harrison Reel: Hail caesar is dope
12/6/16, 16:31:57: Harrison Reel: Everything about it was dope
12/6/16, 16:32:03: Morgan: hazelnut is what I came up with
12/6/16, 16:32:08: Harrison Reel: Yall will like it more next time u see it i promise
12/6/16, 16:32:16: Harrison Reel: Yall r sleeping on hail caesar
12/6/16, 16:32:20: Harrison Reel: Just sayin
12/6/16, 16:32:26: Harrison Reel: But ya what flavor that
12/6/16, 16:32:31: Morgan: hazelnut
12/6/16, 16:32:34: AndreW: I'm gonna skip it
12/6/16, 16:32:45: AndreW: I never like those Hollywood insider movies
12/6/16, 16:32:46: Morgan: it's hnut
12/6/16, 16:32:56: Harrison Reel: What bout the entourage movie
12/6/16, 16:32:59: AndreW: Where they make fun of themselves
12/6/16, 16:33:05: Harrison Reel: What bout roger rabbit
12/6/16, 16:33:08: AndreW: Unless its entourage
12/6/16, 16:33:22: Harrison Reel: What bout that scene in the beginning of mortal kombat
12/6/16, 16:33:37: AndreW: Because the real celebs only show up to say hi
12/6/16, 16:34:02: Morgan: hollywood insider movies like mulholland dr and barton fink
12/6/16, 16:34:32: Morgan: hey I have tech bro chat to share after a morning of researching backups having too much coffee
12/6/16, 16:35:24: Morgan: i was looking for a service to accomplish a backup that an attacker with your passwords couldn't delete
12/6/16, 16:35:38: Morgan: and there isn't really one
12/6/16, 16:36:18: Morgan: so it seems like it would be cool to resell amazon s3 and glacier for people to use without having delete permission
12/6/16, 16:36:43: Morgan: just give out the read / upload keys and then keep the data available for however long they pay
12/6/16, 16:36:56: Morgan: it could even be anonymous
12/6/16, 16:37:26: jelipe: <‎image omitted>
12/6/16, 16:37:41: AndreW: That sounds like a good idea
12/6/16, 16:37:52: AndreW: My paranoid uncle would probably buy iy
12/6/16, 16:37:54: AndreW: It
12/6/16, 16:38:42: Morgan: you could charge a small amount for the amazon proxying and more for user friendly upload/download
12/6/16, 16:39:00: AndreW: You could probably find another group of clients who have large amounts of secret, precious data
12/6/16, 16:39:10: Morgan: yeah that is an issue
12/6/16, 16:40:22: Morgan: but I wonder if anything that gets uploaded would ever have to be data you can access
12/6/16, 16:42:23: Morgan: I think you have same liability as amazon and you're fine
12/6/16, 16:43:00: AndreW: Yeah. Its doable
12/6/16, 16:43:15: Morgan: and you could limit retrievals to avoid becoming a cheap anonymizing file host
12/6/16, 16:44:33: jelipe: what kind of data are u hiding?
12/6/16, 16:45:11: Morgan: I was just making a table of backup scenarios
12/6/16, 16:45:23: Morgan: and honestly if someone took my laptop they could just sign in and delete all cloud backups
12/6/16, 16:45:39: jelipe: i went to a market w my exgf and im pretty sure I saw a guy selling underage porn burned cd roms
12/6/16, 16:45:44: Morgan: or future cryptolocker could do that easily
12/6/16, 16:45:49: Morgan: gross
12/6/16, 16:45:58: jelipe: speaking of your data
12/6/16, 16:46:02: Morgan: would you vigilante them
12/6/16, 16:46:06: jelipe: no
12/6/16, 16:46:41: jelipe: maybe if it was babies or puppies or something
12/6/16, 16:46:48: jelipe: otherwise im pretty apathetic
12/6/16, 16:48:50: Morgan: I need a .io domain
12/6/16, 16:49:24: AndreW: Secretbackup.io
12/6/16, 16:50:00: AndreW: Backupyours.io
12/6/16, 16:50:31: Morgan: phil did you ever get philipreed.techmage ?
12/6/16, 16:51:06: AndreW: Hahah
12/6/16, 16:52:53: Morgan: endur.io is taken but is an empty parked page
12/6/16, 16:53:14: AndreW: What about endr.io
12/6/16, 16:53:55: Morgan: ooh
12/6/16, 16:53:57: Morgan: so short too
12/6/16, 16:54:36: Morgan: that def reads as ender
12/6/16, 16:54:44: Morgan: like the space boy
12/6/16, 16:56:07: Morgan: it also spells end rio
12/6/16, 16:57:23: AndreW: Hahha
12/6/16, 16:57:30: Morgan: is there a cool name for like a castle you can flee to
12/6/16, 16:58:25: AndreW: Keep seems the most appropriate
12/6/16, 16:58:45: Morgan: it's cool that if you have a .io domain you can be just some guy with no formal security training and people will still trust your service because it's hip to jump in with no rubber on
12/6/16, 16:59:36: AndreW: Hahaha
12/6/16, 17:00:14: AndreW: When I worked at ooshirts.com they were developing shirts.io because it was cooler
12/6/16, 17:01:01: Morgan: https://scalablepress.com/
12/6/16, 17:01:07: Morgan: is that redirect the same company
12/6/16, 17:01:22: Morgan: make us some reel shirts
12/6/16, 17:01:43: Morgan: although I don't really like wearing black tees these days
12/6/16, 17:01:53: Morgan: could just add the logo to some nice americal apparel colors
12/6/16, 17:01:56: AndreW: Hmm I dunno. I haven't worked there for 3 years
12/6/16, 17:11:12: Morgan: pawsoffmydatapal.io
12/6/16, 17:11:30: jelipe: Whats today gunna be guys? Tae Bo Cardio? or Insanity Fast and Furious laptop work outs?
12/6/16, 17:11:43: Morgan: oh man idk I need to do something
12/6/16, 17:11:50: jelipe: 2004 was a good year for cardio
12/6/16, 17:11:53: Morgan: might just walk in the woods with the dog
12/6/16, 17:12:30: Morgan: shit what is this garbage daylight fuck the latitude
12/6/16, 17:13:15: jelipe: in 1999 when I was in boarding middle school I used to sit on a bunch of couches with the guys positioned in a semi circle
12/6/16, 17:13:29: jelipe: and we would watch like 5-6 girls doing tae bo
12/6/16, 17:13:40: Morgan: phil gets 1:30 more daylight than me
12/6/16, 17:13:44: jelipe: we were all wearing khaki shorts i remember too
12/6/16, 17:14:03: Morgan: plenty of boner disguising cargo pockets
12/6/16, 17:14:08: jelipe: yeah
12/6/16, 17:14:16: jelipe: i think some of that was def going on
12/6/16, 17:14:34: jelipe: and then one day I just decided fuck it and I became one of them
12/6/16, 17:15:16: Morgan: is the weather ever bad in cdmx?

12/6/16, 17:16:37: jelipe: depends on where u are there is 'contaminacion'
12/6/16, 17:17:19: jelipe: they try to control it, so if you have a car, you cant drive it two days a week
12/6/16, 17:17:27: jelipe: but the mexicans defeated that rule
12/6/16, 17:17:43: jelipe: by each family buying cars for the days they cant drive
12/6/16, 17:18:07: Morgan: hmm $160 to fly one way mid january

12/6/16, 17:23:24: jelipe: you get six months, then you go out the country and get another 6 months
12/6/16, 17:23:30: jelipe: you can do that forever
12/6/16, 17:23:48: jelipe: if you accidently or intentionally stay over, you can just like

12/6/16, 17:25:29: jelipe: yeah I can probably help you get a job
12/6/16, 17:25:38: Morgan: I wonder if I can brush up and get a devel econ position
12/6/16, 17:25:43: AndreW: or that high paying tech job that phil's friend got who moved there who phil's very happy for
12/6/16, 17:25:45: jelipe: yeah

12/6/16, 17:27:19: AndreW: let's just all quit
12/6/16, 17:27:40: jelipe: andrew you should just keep your job and live as ultimate king here
12/6/16, 17:28:27: jelipe: you could go to the grocery store and get two ice creams, one for yourself, and one just to feed to the cats outside
12/6/16, 17:28:27: AndreW: i'm worried the checks won't make it to mexico
12/6/16, 17:28:40: AndreW: and i have a cat to raise
12/6/16, 17:28:45: jelipe: they would, they have amazon here
12/6/16, 17:29:05: jelipe: I just bought Splender on amazon
12/6/16, 17:29:24: AndreW: you said that you can't order from amazon because if your package doesn't get stolen off your porch, the mailman will steal it
12/6/16, 17:29:37: jelipe: but I had it sent to a rich friend
12/6/16, 17:29:53: jelipe: because I cant even get a dominoes delivered at my current address
12/6/16, 17:30:10: jelipe: cuz there is no ringer and and extra door
12/6/16, 17:30:42: jelipe: but there is no wellsfargos down here
12/6/16, 17:30:53: jelipe: cant your job direct deposit?
12/6/16, 17:31:21: AndreW: they won't do it for me
12/6/16, 17:31:31: AndreW: because i'm not a real employee
12/6/16, 17:31:34: AndreW: just a contractor
12/6/16, 17:31:49: jelipe: oh hmmm
12/6/16, 17:31:58: jelipe: there has to be some solution
12/6/16, 17:32:09: AndreW: but it's been a while since i asked. that was like 2 acquisitions ago
12/6/16, 17:32:25: AndreW: plus i don't really want to live in mexico
12/6/16, 17:32:34: jelipe: cant you just have mojalali deposit for u? in exchange for him getting to raise your cat?
12/6/16, 17:32:44: AndreW: he hates my cat
12/6/16, 17:33:09: AndreW: because my cat doesn't like his cat
12/6/16, 17:33:16: AndreW: and they get in fights
12/6/16, 17:33:25: AndreW: but he doesn't really love his cat
12/6/16, 17:33:31: AndreW: he doesn't even let her in his room
12/6/16, 17:33:35: jelipe: mexico is really not too much different than how you live in pdx
12/6/16, 17:33:41: jelipe: just less boardgame nights
12/6/16, 17:33:58: jelipe: walmart, gym, steam is way cheaper
12/6/16, 17:34:04: jelipe: its just the same but cheaper
12/6/16, 17:35:05: jelipe: i forsee mexico city becoming new cool place like portland
12/6/16, 17:36:49: jelipe: well
12/6/16, 17:37:06: jelipe: like williamsburg/SF/NYC/PDX

12/7/16, 23:14:19: Harrison Reel: Adult swim show that just got.cancelled
12/7/16, 23:14:26: Harrison Reel: Cause the creators are alt right
12/7/16, 23:14:30: Harrison Reel: But whoa dude
12/7/16, 23:14:37: Harrison Reel: Short eps, 11 min
12/7/16, 23:39:53: AndreW: ok just watched it
12/7/16, 23:40:07: AndreW: it got better as it went
12/7/16, 23:41:36: Harrison Reel: I agree
12/7/16, 23:41:49: Harrison Reel: Wasnt really feelin that bully sketch
12/7/16, 23:42:00: AndreW: i kinda liked that one
12/7/16, 23:42:05: Harrison Reel: The hooker one got me crackin up at the end when the cop is yelling
12/7/16, 23:42:10: AndreW: yeah
12/7/16, 23:42:18: AndreW: i was into the hooker sketch
12/7/16, 23:42:20: Harrison Reel: Also really dug the opening and closing credits
12/7/16, 23:42:32: Harrison Reel: Ya that was dialed in man
12/7/16, 23:42:42: AndreW: but the girls talking about it was better than the scenes with the hookers
12/7/16, 23:42:49: Harrison Reel: Ya
12/7/16, 23:42:53: AndreW: and the cop was good
12/7/16, 23:43:18: AndreW: seems dumb to cancel it
12/7/16, 23:43:28: AndreW: the alt right needs a voice in comedy
12/7/16, 23:43:49: Harrison Reel: This ep didnt seem v alt righty but mayb the other ones r
12/7/16, 23:44:12: Harrison Reel: Apparently someone quit adult swim over this
12/7/16, 23:44:13: AndreW: i read the wiki article and it said that it was censored before broadcast
12/7/16, 23:44:26: Harrison Reel: Ya i followed that citation
12/7/16, 23:44:48: Harrison Reel: And the original article claims that swastikas are the kind of thing they censored out
12/7/16, 23:44:54: Harrison Reel: Which is v strange to me
12/7/16, 23:45:07: AndreW: hmm
12/7/16, 23:45:10: Harrison Reel: Also tim heidecker really was against it apparently
12/7/16, 23:45:17: AndreW: depends on their use
12/7/16, 23:45:24: AndreW: maybe the guy was a jerk to work with
12/7/16, 23:45:32: Harrison Reel: But i bet this cancellation is gonna just propel them to more publicity
12/7/16, 23:45:50: Harrison Reel: And theyre gonna go w all the other cancelled for being alt right peeps
12/7/16, 23:46:00: Harrison Reel: And start a mega streaming service

12/9/16, 19:28:06: jelipe: well
12/9/16, 19:28:21: jelipe: most of them probably asphyxiated before they charred out
12/9/16, 19:28:27: jelipe: so at least thats better
12/9/16, 19:28:57: jelipe: you just kinda lose conciousness but the air smells bad
12/9/16, 19:29:28: jelipe: before the concentration camps the nazis used to have those vans or trucks to do it
12/9/16, 19:29:42: jelipe: thats also how my dad committed suicide
12/9/16, 19:29:58: jelipe: seems better than ISIS style witch burning
12/9/16, 19:30:09: jelipe: am I getting too deep?
12/9/16, 19:31:02: AndreW: You'd probably pass out pretty fast that way too.
12/9/16, 19:31:33: AndreW: Or maybe pass out, but dream about getting burned up
12/9/16, 19:31:41: Kevin: I hear helium is good for that

12/9/16, 19:32:14: Kevin: Saw that?
12/9/16, 19:32:19: jelipe: she was like on fire for 2 minutes screaming before she went silent
12/9/16, 19:32:33: Kevin: Daaamn

12/9/16, 19:33:05: jelipe: and shot him to death and stole his money
12/9/16, 19:33:09: jelipe: then they all ran away
12/9/16, 19:33:13: jelipe: but they caught her
12/9/16, 19:33:16: jelipe: she was like 16
12/9/16, 19:33:43: Kevin: Jeez

12/9/16, 19:34:48: jelipe: and also his hands
12/9/16, 19:34:55: jelipe: and he was still alive
12/9/16, 19:35:12: jelipe: and they kept trying to cut his neck with an exacto knife or box cutter
12/9/16, 19:35:22: jelipe: but he kept blocking it with his stumps
12/9/16, 19:35:29: jelipe: and screaming
12/9/16, 19:35:33: Kevin: Eyes without lids is a no no for me
12/9/16, 19:35:46: jelipe: but there was so much blood in his throat it was like gurlging
12/9/16, 19:35:50: jelipe: no eyes
12/9/16, 19:35:53: jelipe: no lids
12/9/16, 19:35:55: jelipe: no face
12/9/16, 19:36:09: jelipe: not even lips
12/9/16, 19:36:34: jelipe: just a red skeleton man who somehow achieved conciousness after most would go into shock
12/9/16, 19:39:14: jelipe: i actually saw that on FB

12/14/16, 02:42:05: Morgan: No but I thought I heard talking before I saw that
12/14/16, 02:43:11: Morgan: My housemate got up because I yelled at the guy and went and stood in the *front* yard
12/14/16, 02:43:59: jelipe: when you heard talking, did you hear itw your ears, or did you kind of feel it
12/14/16, 02:44:05: jelipe: with your mind
12/14/16, 02:44:09: Morgan: I guess it's possible that they would emerge from the houses but still,
12/14/16, 02:44:19: Morgan: I think I heard it?!?
12/14/16, 02:44:44: Morgan: Did u astral project here to climb over my wet woodpile?

12/14/16, 02:48:33: Morgan: I have a cheap webcam I got for free, I wonder if I can remove the IR filter
12/14/16, 02:49:23: jelipe: what if you built a booby trap and killed a grey
12/14/16, 02:49:35: jelipe: what would be the first thing you would do
12/14/16, 02:49:51: Morgan: I have thought about that before
12/14/16, 02:50:09: Morgan: Because I used to be pretty concerned about aliens
12/14/16, 02:50:16: Morgan: I think you would be fucked
12/14/16, 02:50:33: Morgan: That is a hot freaking potato to be holding
12/14/16, 02:50:44: jelipe: from any angle
12/14/16, 02:50:50: jelipe: MiBs
12/14/16, 02:50:55: jelipe: or alien retaliation
12/14/16, 02:51:04: jelipe: both can find you
12/14/16, 02:51:52: Morgan: Your only shot would be to get rid of it cleanly and hope the aliens don't see any reason to follow up
12/14/16, 02:52:10: jelipe: hahahahah
12/14/16, 02:52:25: jelipe: i would frame someone else
12/14/16, 02:52:35: Morgan: What if it has like a black box recorder implant that they can use to resurrect
12/14/16, 02:52:59: jelipe: decapitate
12/14/16, 02:53:01: Morgan: And you melt that down by accident and have now committed a hell crime
12/14/16, 02:53:22: jelipe: hahahahahah
12/14/16, 02:53:41: jelipe: i would frame a neighbor and move the body
12/14/16, 02:53:49: AndreW: Hahaha
12/14/16, 02:54:01: jelipe: or I would drag the thing to coty hall and nail it to the door/entrance
12/14/16, 02:54:19: Morgan: And they dedicate the power output of a small fusion reactor to simulating pure suffering and hook your conscious up to that for 5000 years
12/14/16, 02:54:24: jelipe: suprise the mayor
12/14/16, 02:54:50: jelipe: man that would suck
12/14/16, 02:55:10: Morgan: Yep
12/14/16, 02:55:45: jelipe: i guess all the scenarios are based around the type of grey we are dealing with
12/14/16, 02:56:41: Morgan: You'd think they'd be better prepared than to leave you with an et corpse to fret over
12/14/16, 02:57:58: jelipe: well thats a malicious grey
12/14/16, 02:58:21: jelipe: some are exporers or maybe guardians but also really scary
12/14/16, 02:58:50: jelipe: but it would prob be a malicious grey, or Maligris
12/14/16, 02:59:42: jelipe: or maligricho
12/14/16, 02:59:49: Morgan: Can't they send a coffin bot
12/14/16, 03:00:18: jelipe: would they bother with funerals
12/14/16, 03:00:24: jelipe: or just trigger a remote disolve
12/14/16, 03:00:28: Morgan: Are those just transpositions of angel/demon mythology
12/14/16, 03:00:36: jelipe: they prob know immediately
12/14/16, 03:00:50: jelipe: when one dies
12/14/16, 03:01:23: jelipe: i need to get that book to hell in back in a UfO
12/14/16, 03:01:36: jelipe: that andrew found
12/14/16, 03:01:48: Morgan: If they walk around naked on a strange planet and get merked by a pajamas guy then they probably are treating those bodies as expendable
12/14/16, 03:02:00: jelipe: yeah
12/14/16, 03:02:16: Morgan: They have cylon upload
12/14/16, 03:14:31: Morgan: Maybe I should use some of that twine to make some traps
12/14/16, 03:14:48: Morgan: Gotta rewatch true detective s1
12/14/16, 03:16:44: AndreW: Tie that alien corpse to a tree when you're done with her
12/14/16, 03:24:46: jelipe: haha

12/14/16, 21:05:22: jelipe: splayed out and spiced
12/14/16, 21:05:24: Morgan: I will when they are here
12/14/16, 21:05:36: jelipe: those delectable dominos victuals
12/14/16, 21:05:39: Harrison Reel: Im not sayings its super dope or that it deserves its reputation in totality or all of its accolades but it def has stuff in it i aint heard elsewhere
12/14/16, 21:05:45: Harrison Reel: And stuffed i still think about
12/14/16, 21:05:49: Harrison Reel: Parts i want to reread
12/14/16, 21:05:51: Morgan: Sold
12/14/16, 21:06:19: Morgan: That's what I get out of sci-fi the most
12/14/16, 21:08:29: Morgan: Like highly developed unique situations that give you a remote reference point to compare things with
12/14/16, 21:09:05: Harrison Reel: Ya dude
12/14/16, 21:09:23: Harrison Reel: Snow crash will provide you w another few for sure
12/14/16, 21:09:31: Harrison Reel: At least one or two
12/14/16, 21:09:55: Morgan: "This is a total Johnny Rico situation," he explained learnedly
12/14/16, 21:11:02: Harrison Reel: You dont need the last word
12/14/16, 21:11:07: Harrison Reel: Its implier by the content
12/14/16, 21:11:28: Harrison Reel: Only the learned, would and could, say such a thing
12/14/16, 21:12:05: Harrison Reel: Or, alternately...only the learned could, let alone would, make such a reference
12/14/16, 21:12:21: Harrison Reel: Nor sure which approach is more accurate
12/14/16, 21:12:26: Harrison Reel: But u feel me
12/14/16, 21:13:35: Morgan: Yes
12/14/16, 21:13:44: Morgan: Show don't tell
12/14/16, 21:19:27: Morgan: <‎video omitted>
12/14/16, 21:22:18: Harrison Reel: Fuuuuuuuck dude
12/14/16, 21:22:20: Harrison Reel: Ranch????
12/14/16, 21:22:45: Morgan: Add a ranch cup for just 50c?
12/14/16, 21:23:08: Harrison Reel: Mmmmm
12/14/16, 21:28:24: jelipe: oh!
12/14/16, 21:28:57: jelipe: im all about that beef and banana peppers pizza
12/14/16, 21:29:03: jelipe: thats the better one huh?
12/14/16, 21:29:13: Morgan: Maybe
12/14/16, 21:29:20: jelipe: are we all reading on kindles?
12/14/16, 21:29:31: jelipe: and pirating our books?
12/14/16, 21:30:08: Harrison Reel: I like the lie berry
12/14/16, 21:30:51: jelipe: we should start a book club
12/14/16, 21:31:09: jelipe: discuss it in the chat
12/14/16, 21:31:17: Harrison Reel: Into it.
12/14/16, 21:31:56: Morgan: How did that happen with dune?
12/14/16, 21:32:11: Morgan: Did anyone say "read dune"
12/14/16, 21:32:45: Morgan: One day it was just oh I am reading dune too
12/14/16, 21:34:16: jelipe: no
12/14/16, 21:34:34: jelipe: but we could decide on a weekly book or theme
12/14/16, 21:34:41: jelipe: and choose one
12/14/16, 21:35:19: jelipe: I like all types
12/14/16, 21:35:31: jelipe: even _literature_
12/14/16, 21:36:04: Morgan: Same
12/14/16, 21:36:31: Morgan: I like all genres and every type of food
12/14/16, 21:36:58: jelipe: ok how is this for a way to decide?
12/14/16, 21:37:01: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:37:06: jelipe: we all think of a book
12/14/16, 21:37:21: jelipe: but dont share it in the chat
12/14/16, 21:37:36: jelipe: and then somebody sends it to harrison
12/14/16, 21:37:44: jelipe: who makes a twitter poll
12/14/16, 21:37:50: jelipe: and thats how we select
12/14/16, 21:38:30: jelipe: or we do the same with "wheel decide" and someone videos the results
12/14/16, 21:38:57: Morgan: We need ranked choice voting
12/14/16, 21:39:09: jelipe: hmm yeeah
12/14/16, 21:39:28: jelipe: whats the best system?
12/14/16, 21:39:31: Morgan: Otherwise whoever is loser enough to not vote their own book is a swing state
12/14/16, 21:39:40: Harrison Reel: I still want to be involvdd
12/14/16, 21:39:44: jelipe: yeahhhh
12/14/16, 21:39:46: Morgan: Hahaha
12/14/16, 21:39:50: jelipe: i didnt think of that at all
12/14/16, 21:39:52: Harrison Reel: And kevin no u dont get two electoral votes dont even ask
12/14/16, 21:40:03: jelipe: but like harrisons other friends would vote
12/14/16, 21:40:12: Morgan: Kevin wants to be 6/5ths
12/14/16, 21:40:13: Harrison Reel: Whoa ua
12/14/16, 21:40:33: jelipe: friends who dont even know its me submitting "The Vampire Lestat" by Anne Rice
12/14/16, 21:40:46: jelipe: or andrews "The Divinci Code"
12/14/16, 21:41:12: Morgan: What are the guidelines for submitting in good faith?
12/14/16, 21:41:29: Morgan: Is it ok to have read the book already?
12/14/16, 21:41:36: jelipe: hmmmm
12/14/16, 21:41:40: Morgan: Within the last year?
12/14/16, 21:41:49: jelipe: it has to have been like at least 5 years ago
12/14/16, 21:41:53: jelipe: maybe 10
12/14/16, 21:42:08: jelipe: ideally we should all grow from this experience
12/14/16, 21:42:28: jelipe: and under like 1000 pages
12/14/16, 21:42:32: Morgan: Should you submit a book that is definitely on everyone's radar already or try to be bringing in fresh data
12/14/16, 21:42:53: Morgan: Like if you haven't read infinite jest yet should I point that out to you
12/14/16, 21:42:57: jelipe: as long as it is popular enough for all of us to steal online
12/14/16, 21:43:10: jelipe: isnt that book like hella long?
12/14/16, 21:43:16: jelipe: like 1000 pages or more?
12/14/16, 21:43:17: Morgan: I guess there are some things that I wouldn't read alone but would for a club
12/14/16, 21:43:23: jelipe: yeah
12/14/16, 21:43:31: jelipe: i would read almost anything for a club
12/14/16, 21:43:41: jelipe: cuz I would be paying more attention
12/14/16, 21:43:41: Morgan: Can I earn xp
12/14/16, 21:43:49: jelipe: yea we can gamify it
12/14/16, 21:44:19: Morgan: Can we get on an app that parents use to force their illiterate children to read more than 140 characters at a time
12/14/16, 21:44:38: jelipe: yeah sure
12/14/16, 21:44:46: jelipe: but the hard part is the deciding
12/14/16, 21:45:02: jelipe: I think shorter books are good
12/14/16, 21:45:07: Morgan: Yeah
12/14/16, 21:45:12: jelipe: at least at first
12/14/16, 21:45:20: jelipe: til we get the hang of reading words
12/14/16, 21:45:52: Morgan: We could tweak the format a little for special events like long ass book week or manga
12/14/16, 21:46:11: jelipe: or Easter Suprise
12/14/16, 21:46:13: jelipe: sure
12/14/16, 21:46:32: Morgan: The surprise is catholic books only
12/14/16, 21:46:39: jelipe: haah
12/14/16, 21:46:47: jelipe: well how can we decide?
12/14/16, 21:46:54: jelipe: or should we go down a list?
12/14/16, 21:47:20: jelipe: a list someone else made maybe
12/14/16, 21:47:22: Harrison Reel: Were obv not doin infinite jest
12/14/16, 21:47:28: jelipe: hahahaha
12/14/16, 21:47:39: Harrison Reel: Id rather do the bible
12/14/16, 21:47:42: jelipe: is that on audible for andrew?
12/14/16, 21:47:45: Morgan: Can you google some kind of web app for polls and we'll just see if it works
12/14/16, 21:47:59: jelipe: oh we should def have religious texts month
12/14/16, 21:48:06: jelipe: yeaj
12/14/16, 21:48:12: jelipe: i could probably build one
12/14/16, 21:48:12: Harrison Reel: Into it
12/14/16, 21:48:25: jelipe: but there is prob a million already
12/14/16, 21:48:26: Morgan: Need to reread mahabharata
12/14/16, 21:48:27: Harrison Reel: Also philip k dicks exegesis would be bananas
12/14/16, 21:48:46: Morgan: Yeah we could just derail this into online poll software
12/14/16, 21:49:04: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:49:18: jelipe: but are we going to submit books?
12/14/16, 21:49:26: jelipe: or lists
12/14/16, 21:49:30: Morgan: Yes I will find some and make a list
12/14/16, 21:49:34: jelipe: and then go down the list
12/14/16, 21:49:41: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:49:42: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:49:44: Morgan: We should all send lists
12/14/16, 21:49:45: jelipe: everybody
12/14/16, 21:50:01: Morgan: And then merge them
12/14/16, 21:50:04: jelipe: send a 5 book list
12/14/16, 21:50:06: Morgan: And then vote on that
12/14/16, 21:50:12: jelipe: or scramble them
12/14/16, 21:50:19: jelipe: and just go down it?
12/14/16, 21:50:26: Morgan: We should do it blindly
12/14/16, 21:51:01: Morgan: And make it 5-10 books
12/14/16, 21:51:07: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:51:09: jelipe: 10 books
12/14/16, 21:51:14: jelipe: who is in
12/14/16, 21:51:20: Morgan: 5-10
12/14/16, 21:51:23: jelipe: you me andrew harry
12/14/16, 21:51:30: jelipe: kevin?
12/14/16, 21:51:48: jelipe: might have to text him
12/14/16, 21:52:00: Morgan: I can get any ePub by requesting it on bacon bits I think
12/14/16, 21:52:07: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 21:52:28: Morgan: There are people who reupload from elite book trackers
12/14/16, 21:52:40: jelipe: unless it is super obscure i can get it w pirate of google
12/14/16, 21:53:04: Morgan: Did you say anything about nonfiction
12/14/16, 21:53:15: jelipe: so compile all our 5-10 books in a list
12/14/16, 21:53:20: jelipe: im ok w nonfiction
12/14/16, 21:53:36: jelipe: but i prefer fiction
12/14/16, 21:53:45: jelipe: maybe 1-5
12/14/16, 21:53:53: jelipe: 2-10
12/14/16, 21:53:55: Morgan: Yeah well then it can get voted up
12/14/16, 21:54:00: jelipe: could be a non fiction
12/14/16, 21:54:13: jelipe: ok so compile the books in a list, scrambled
12/14/16, 21:54:21: jelipe: then choose one at a time randomly?
12/14/16, 21:54:39: jelipe: or vote
12/14/16, 21:55:42: Morgan: Vote I think
12/14/16, 21:56:44: Morgan: But how
12/14/16, 21:58:35: jelipe: maybe we all get like 4 votes?
12/14/16, 21:58:39: jelipe: no
12/14/16, 21:58:41: jelipe: more
12/14/16, 21:59:17: jelipe: votes = half number of books?
12/14/16, 22:00:21: Morgan: So the list can be a growing database we use for future "weeks"
12/14/16, 22:00:32: jelipe: yeah
12/14/16, 22:00:38: Morgan: To choose each time we have to cut it down to a manageable choice
12/14/16, 22:01:31: Morgan: So like vote unordered for like 3-5 per person and then do ranked choice on the survivors
12/14/16, 22:01:42: jelipe: hahahah
12/14/16, 22:02:15: jelipe: say we have 30 books
12/14/16, 22:02:21: jelipe: we each get 15 votes
12/14/16, 22:02:29: jelipe: 1 vote per book max
12/14/16, 22:02:39: jelipe: then we present the list w votes applied
12/14/16, 22:02:39: Morgan: No it's too many votes
12/14/16, 22:02:45: jelipe: and that the order
12/14/16, 22:03:08: jelipe: cuz everyone will vote for their own books
12/14/16, 22:03:16: Morgan: It's good to have a lot of books because you might want to vote for one you haven't heard of, even more than the person who submitted
12/14/16, 22:04:22: Morgan: Like Andrew can be lazy and submit the whole Harry Potter series and then vote for our elite choices instead when he sees how cool they are
12/14/16, 22:04:38: jelipe: yeah
12/14/16, 22:04:59: jelipe: so whats the system
12/14/16, 22:05:02: Morgan: I think we should have a selection round and ranked choice round each week
12/14/16, 22:05:20: Morgan: So each person marks exactly 3 books from the list
12/14/16, 22:06:05: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:06:04: Morgan: We have between [3,3*people] books from that
12/14/16, 22:06:18: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:06:43: jelipe: so lets try to get the selection in tonight
12/14/16, 22:06:45: Morgan: Then for each of those rank your choices
12/14/16, 22:06:48: jelipe: submissions
12/14/16, 22:07:04: Morgan: And do instant runoff to find the winner
12/14/16, 22:07:13: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:07:29: jelipe: im going to find 7 or 8 books i want to read
12/14/16, 22:07:39: Morgan: We should just use a google sheet we all can edit
12/14/16, 22:07:43: jelipe: and put them in a pastbin
12/14/16, 22:07:48: jelipe: ok yeah
12/14/16, 22:09:18: jelipe: so we got 4 people
12/14/16, 22:09:29: jelipe: andrew is awol probably slimin
12/14/16, 22:09:41: jelipe: im sure he is in though
12/14/16, 22:10:07: jelipe: should we invite katie? or peter? too ambitious?
12/14/16, 22:10:48: Morgan: like in week 3
12/14/16, 22:11:06: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:11:18: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:11:23: Morgan: kk

12/14/16, 22:24:17: jelipe: you want me to add years?
12/14/16, 22:24:33: Morgan: if you want, optional
12/14/16, 22:25:12: jelipe: maybe a link to the summary on amazon too would be good
12/14/16, 22:25:21: Morgan: links in sheets kind of suck
12/14/16, 22:25:28: Morgan: we can just google
12/14/16, 22:25:34: jelipe: ah ok
12/14/16, 22:25:57: Morgan: oh they got a little better
12/14/16, 22:26:12: Morgan: so yeah those would be fine
12/14/16, 22:26:37: Morgan: should we use the notes cell for that?
12/14/16, 22:26:40: jelipe: whats better, amazon or goodreads
12/14/16, 22:26:45: jelipe: teah
12/14/16, 22:26:47: jelipe: yeah
12/14/16, 22:27:06: Morgan: we have 4 people+ editing, let them decide what to put in i guess
12/14/16, 22:27:22: jelipe: ok
12/14/16, 22:27:26: Morgan: you can add multiple links if you have them
12/14/16, 22:33:44: jelipe: ok so im done
12/14/16, 23:21:25: jelipe: two books in my selection have the word "blood" in it
12/14/16, 23:21:49: jelipe: why did you select 'year of magical thinking' morgan?
12/14/16, 23:22:19: Morgan: I have the book because someone recommended it to me
12/14/16, 23:22:42: Morgan: and then I recently saw joan didion cited on twitter as someone's favorite author
12/14/16, 23:23:15: Morgan: I will find two more
12/14/16, 23:23:31: Morgan: but I'm trying to implement instant runoff voting first
12/14/16, 23:49:09: Morgan: whoa go to the IRV tab on the spreadsheet and find the instant runoff menu in the main menu bar and hit run
12/14/16, 23:54:02: jelipe: whoa is that a program you made
12/14/16, 23:54:10: jelipe: i dont really know excel very well
12/14/16, 23:54:38: Morgan: No I just searched and found it on github then copied it in and set the sheet names
12/14/16, 23:55:05: Morgan: do you have the menu? I don't know if it's linked to my account or the sheet

12/16/16, 10:36:35: Morgan: I think we can move to nominations for this week, and get some more kevin/andrew books later
12/16/16, 10:36:55: Morgan: so everyone mark 3 nominations on the bookdb sheet
12/16/16, 10:37:13: Morgan: if you overlap with an existing one that's ok
12/16/16, 13:03:50: jelipe: ok
12/16/16, 13:03:59: jelipe: kevin might not have time
12/16/16, 13:04:05: jelipe: i think andrew added a bunch
12/16/16, 13:04:12: jelipe: we have like 30
12/16/16, 13:04:40: jelipe: but whats to stop us just electing our own books?
12/16/16, 13:04:46: jelipe: w only 3 choices
12/16/16, 13:05:00: Morgan: you can nominate your own books if you want
12/16/16, 13:05:04: Morgan: do what feels good
12/16/16, 13:05:34: jelipe: but i think thats why we need more votes
12/16/16, 13:05:40: Morgan: after we nom we will have 12 to choose from
12/16/16, 13:05:43: Morgan: then we rank those, and then the runoff picks a winner
12/16/16, 13:05:46: jelipe: so that we can obviously choose our own
12/16/16, 13:06:07: jelipe: then we have extra votes for others
12/16/16, 13:06:22: Morgan: we're going to do this several times
12/16/16, 13:06:33: jelipe: ok
12/16/16, 13:06:33: Morgan: we'll get through enough of the books
12/16/16, 13:06:39: jelipe: ok
12/16/16, 13:06:47: jelipe: km going to vote now
12/16/16, 13:06:51: Morgan: we have to narrow it down each week
12/16/16, 13:06:55: jelipe: whats the voting cutoff?
12/16/16, 13:07:07: Morgan: nominate your 3 and then once we all have done that we can rank vote
12/16/16, 13:07:41: Morgan: if we go down to two noms we'll only have 8 to choose from which might be better than 12, what do you think?
12/16/16, 13:07:44: Morgan: is 12 too many?
12/16/16, 13:07:52: Morgan: if kevin comes in it will be 15
12/16/16, 13:08:01: Morgan: or 10 if we reduce to 2
12/16/16, 13:08:16: jelipe: ok
12/16/16, 13:08:20: jelipe: everyone vote
12/16/16, 13:11:01: Morgan: yeah let's just nominate 3 this time and see how it goes

12/16/16, 17:34:10: Harrison Reel: Thats closer to breaking up but still not the same thing.
12/16/16, 17:34:15: Harrison Reel: Either way

12/16/16, 21:30:24: Harrison Reel: Theres a series of mystery books about a woman who solves murders w her cat
12/16/16, 21:30:32: AndreW: He goes to cat hell
12/16/16, 21:30:38: AndreW: And beyond
12/16/16, 21:31:02: Morgan: whoa

12/16/16, 21:31:27: jelipe: i bet those sell well in pdx
12/16/16, 21:32:27: Harrison Reel: Dude i got an audiobook of one at a pdx library
12/16/16, 21:32:33: Morgan: I opened that one to a random page and it was something about a dog looking in someone's window and then getting caught and confronted, "I saw you out there, you were laughing... You were laughing at her tits!"
12/16/16, 21:32:47: jelipe: hahahaha
12/16/16, 21:32:50: Harrison Reel: Whoa
12/16/16, 21:32:57: Morgan: idk how I haven't read the whole thing
12/16/16, 21:32:59: Harrison Reel: Morgan tell us about the stories in that book
12/16/16, 21:33:25: Morgan: If you guys vote it to the top next round I will scan the whole thing
12/16/16, 21:33:43: jelipe: nah andrew hates titties
12/16/16, 21:33:55: Morgan: he will identify with that dog then
12/16/16, 21:34:20: Morgan: I don't have that book with me but I will grab it over xmas
12/16/16, 21:35:15: Harrison Reel: But u had a pic handy
12/16/16, 21:35:52: Morgan: i can google "magicats" at any time and have that pic in 5 seconds
12/16/16, 21:36:00: Morgan: magicats is 5 sec away at all times

12/16/16, 21:36:47: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 21:37:03: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 21:37:04: Harrison Reel: Whoa
12/16/16, 21:37:21: Harrison Reel: Thats a good question
12/16/16, 21:37:41: jelipe: looks sick
12/16/16, 21:39:44: Harrison Reel: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 21:40:04: AndreW: Hehehe
12/16/16, 21:40:12: jelipe: hehe
12/16/16, 21:40:14: Morgan: thought i muted carol
12/16/16, 21:40:22: jelipe: kanaka
12/16/16, 21:40:45: Harrison Reel: Is carol dead
12/16/16, 21:44:43: Morgan: killed the chat
12/16/16, 21:47:49: jelipe: hahahah
12/16/16, 21:48:54: Harrison Reel: Her final insult
12/16/16, 21:54:38: Harrison Reel: Whats yall doin
12/16/16, 21:54:42: Harrison Reel: I just texted a girl
12/16/16, 21:54:44: AndreW: Nothing could that old biddy
12/16/16, 21:54:51: Harrison Reel: Also im hungry
12/16/16, 21:54:59: Morgan: Doing laundry
12/16/16, 21:55:04: AndreW: Could kill
12/16/16, 21:55:31: Harrison Reel: Laundry
12/16/16, 21:55:32: Morgan: moved my NAS setup to the closet because the external hdd im using is loud at night
12/16/16, 21:55:42: Harrison Reel: More like yawn-dry
12/16/16, 21:55:53: Harrison Reel: Dang
12/16/16, 21:56:00: Harrison Reel: I wish i knew what that meant
12/16/16, 21:56:04: Harrison Reel: Ill do some googling
12/16/16, 21:57:34: jelipe: im walking to walmart for icecream and soup
12/16/16, 21:57:50: Harrison Reel: What flavors
12/16/16, 21:58:31: jelipe: i dunno
12/16/16, 21:58:49: jelipe: moosetracks maybe
12/16/16, 21:59:01: Morgan: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 21:59:56: jelipe: hahahah
12/16/16, 22:00:18: Morgan: what would look even jankier is to use the sata feature where you pull off the top cover and there is a slot for a laptop drive
12/16/16, 22:00:29: Morgan: you can just have it jutting out of the top like an n64
12/16/16, 22:01:08: Harrison Reel: I roll up to yr crib see i lyin on the floor
12/16/16, 22:01:23: Harrison Reel: I pop out the moonroof juttin out like n64
12/16/16, 22:01:36: Morgan: thats good
12/16/16, 22:01:45: jelipe: is that our server room?
12/16/16, 22:01:46: Morgan: phil produce this baller
12/16/16, 22:03:22: Morgan: that device is pretty nice because it gets good i/o speeds with usb3/sata and gigabit but it is really slow and armv5
12/16/16, 22:03:51: Morgan: so I was trying to run a backup sync program on it that needs to compute file hashes and it was at 100% cpu getting 1 mbit
12/16/16, 22:04:22: Morgan: but it does 150 mbit or more on plain samba file sharing
12/16/16, 22:06:10: Morgan: and it's hard to write any software for it that isn't gcc or python
12/16/16, 22:06:23: Morgan: i guess the sync program i was using is Go but I don't really want to learn that
12/16/16, 22:07:22: Morgan: no nodejs, haskell, rust environments that are easy to get going
12/16/16, 22:15:37: jelipe: nodejs is not too hard
12/16/16, 22:15:42: jelipe: haskell is
12/16/16, 22:22:11: Morgan: haskell is the only one in that list I've actually gotten familiar with
12/16/16, 22:22:19: Morgan: they are all hard to get running on armv5
12/16/16, 22:23:26: jelipe: functional programming
12/16/16, 22:23:39: jelipe: nodejs is easy
12/16/16, 22:23:49: jelipe: its just like python with pip
12/16/16, 22:24:01: jelipe: you can run nodejs in your command line
12/16/16, 22:24:13: jelipe: and use it like command line js and make apps
12/16/16, 22:24:47: Morgan: Yeah
12/16/16, 22:31:22: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 22:31:54: Morgan: 😢
12/16/16, 22:33:28: jelipe: haha
12/16/16, 22:34:15: Harrison Reel: Dang
12/16/16, 22:34:22: Harrison Reel: Gotta come back
12/16/16, 22:34:28: Harrison Reel: Defend my title
12/16/16, 22:34:32: Harrison Reel: Take what is mine
12/16/16, 22:38:33: Morgan: no one might care but what are some cool food plants to grow
12/16/16, 22:38:46: Morgan: going to make my spring list
12/16/16, 22:39:18: Morgan: might start some seeds inside in a week or two
12/16/16, 22:40:50: Harrison Reel: Green beans
12/16/16, 22:41:01: Harrison Reel: They taste great off the vine
12/16/16, 22:41:04: Harrison Reel: No joke
12/16/16, 22:42:03: Morgan: yeah and that's a good crop to rotate through because it's nitrogen-fixing
12/16/16, 22:42:18: Harrison Reel: 😶
12/16/16, 22:43:44: jelipe: potatoes
12/16/16, 22:43:48: jelipe: or sweet potatoes
12/16/16, 22:45:16: Morgan: I have a sweet potato from the grocery store right now
12/16/16, 22:45:20: Morgan: i usually get yams
12/16/16, 22:45:24: Morgan: is it the same
12/16/16, 22:45:30: Morgan: can i microwave it
12/16/16, 22:46:50: Harrison Reel: Yr my sweet potato, morgan
12/16/16, 22:46:57: Harrison Reel: My lil sweet potato
12/16/16, 22:47:03: Morgan: thats cool
12/16/16, 22:47:09: Morgan: ty
12/16/16, 22:47:39: Morgan: gonna go check my existing crops
12/16/16, 22:47:55: Harrison Reel: What r they
12/16/16, 22:48:05: Morgan: i went and bought cheap sheets at goodwill to put over the plants because its going down to 28 degrees tonight
12/16/16, 22:49:08: Morgan: I have fava beans and peas from fall planting, which are the only things that are "on schedule", and then some odds and ends
12/16/16, 22:49:47: Morgan: there's a good amount of komatsuna that I pruned back, which i can probably harvest some greens off of this week now
12/16/16, 22:50:19: Harrison Reel: Whoa dude
12/16/16, 22:50:21: Harrison Reel: Respect
12/16/16, 22:50:23: Morgan: I have radishes coming up, there are a few beets and carrots that came up on their own in the fall after unsuccessful spring planting
12/16/16, 22:50:42: Morgan: planted some spinach but it might not go off
12/16/16, 22:50:46: Morgan: there is one lettuce plant
12/16/16, 22:51:11: Morgan: some arugula that is also left over from spring planting, and some kale in that same category
12/16/16, 22:51:36: Morgan: in may we finished the garden kind of and my housemate made margaritas and wanted to plant everything
12/16/16, 22:52:07: Morgan: I still needed to do a soil test and pick out rows to place
12/16/16, 22:52:21: Morgan: but we just threw all the seeds around in vague zones
12/16/16, 22:53:04: Morgan: so a lot of stuff came up over the summer but a lot of it was not season appropriate and it went to seed almost immediately
12/16/16, 22:53:27: Morgan: tomatoes were transplanted too late and weren't strong enough to get going outside
12/16/16, 22:53:48: Morgan: the weather is kind of extreme here
12/16/16, 22:54:12: Morgan: I had a lot of stuff not come up in october either because it stayed too hot or something
12/16/16, 23:07:28: AndreW: <‎image omitted>
12/16/16, 23:08:26: Harrison Reel: Into it.

12/17/16, 01:32:30: jelipe: no all night purcell style burning man fire dancing parties?
12/17/16, 01:32:56: Morgan: I didn't fall asleep yet
12/17/16, 01:33:43: jelipe: been thinking about a stack for bibliotron?
12/17/16, 01:33:45: jelipe: i been
12/17/16, 01:34:13: Morgan: One of my friends FaceTimed me and we were talking about west world, and how William is the gamer who posts on forums about adding realistic unfun features no one wants
12/17/16, 01:34:28: Morgan: <‎image omitted>
12/17/16, 01:34:42: Morgan: And then I started researching skyrim mods
12/17/16, 01:35:21: jelipe: im downloading music off dropdabass.blogspot.mx
12/17/16, 01:35:39: Morgan: What is your stack concept
12/17/16, 01:35:43: jelipe: and looking up a front end solution
12/17/16, 01:35:58: jelipe: i dont know yet, maybe flask or django backend
12/17/16, 01:36:27: jelipe: or try something new that i dont know like react or ember or the hundred million js solutions
12/17/16, 01:37:29: Morgan: Yeah it would be fun to do a whole app I should
12/17/16, 01:38:41: Morgan: I wonder if any of the amazon db aws apps are worth trying out
12/17/16, 01:39:03: Morgan: Or run Postgres on the server
12/17/16, 01:39:34: Morgan: Or skip it and just have a native in memory persistent store
12/17/16, 01:40:21: Morgan: Don't know what Linux to deploy if I don't want to do the nixos thing
12/17/16, 01:41:47: Morgan: I would probably look at a lightweight Haskell Servant backend and do most of the app in the browser
12/17/16, 01:42:35: Morgan: But I don't know if I would go with like Reflex for ghcjs or write actual JavaScript with one of those frameworks
12/17/16, 01:45:05: jelipe: aws or azure, or digital ocean
12/17/16, 01:45:21: jelipe: and install apache and django or flask
12/17/16, 01:45:44: jelipe: django works w patgres
12/17/16, 01:45:48: jelipe: post
12/17/16, 01:45:54: Morgan: I like aws because they have so many non-vps features
12/17/16, 01:46:18: Morgan: I would scrounge up instances on lowendbox otherwise
12/17/16, 01:46:42: jelipe: minecraft server
12/17/16, 01:46:45: Morgan: The vps is kind of the shittiest part of an app
12/17/16, 01:47:07: Morgan: It's a whole computer
12/17/16, 01:47:24: Morgan: When you really just need it to do one thing
12/17/16, 01:48:32: Morgan: And if you design around one computer then you have scaling problems
12/17/16, 01:49:27: jelipe: scaling for like when kevin joins?
12/17/16, 01:49:37: Morgan: Yes exactly
12/17/16, 01:49:46: jelipe: hahaha
12/17/16, 01:49:54: Morgan: 4 servers is good enough for now...
12/17/16, 01:53:06: Morgan: I could probably run this off of a slow single threaded python server on that box in my closet
12/17/16, 01:53:23: Morgan: But it's good to practice
12/17/16, 04:09:11: jelipe: whats a good hot dog is a standard bacon wrapped dog, in a bun like normal with mayo, a little ketchup, and melted cheese anc pineapple
12/17/16, 04:09:49: AndreW: whoa
12/17/16, 04:10:23: AndreW: are you pushing the wiener through the holes in the pineapple too?
12/17/16, 04:10:44: jelipe: hahaha
12/17/16, 04:10:52: jelipe: only one slice of pinapple
12/17/16, 04:11:06: jelipe: nothing too crazy

12/17/16, 13:46:46: Harrison Reel: Like the "realities" of war?
12/17/16, 13:47:04: Harrison Reel: Dunno a lot of this ive gleaned from thinkpiece headlines which always make everything seem super lame
12/17/16, 13:47:07: Harrison Reel: I wanna see it

12/17/16, 23:15:05: Morgan: windows doesn't have a good term
12/17/16, 23:16:10: Morgan: It's a javascript electron/react/redux app and people are making plugins for it
12/17/16, 23:16:30: Morgan: so it might end up being the best terminal
12/17/16, 23:16:40: Morgan: it's supposed to have truecolor but i can't get it to work
12/17/16, 23:17:35: jelipe: powershell is pretty good
12/17/16, 23:17:46: jelipe: also
12/17/16, 23:17:49: Morgan: it's all the same terminal emulator

12/18/16, 15:47:44: AndreW: they broke up on friday because they got their work schedules (they work at the same store but different locations) and she had one less shift and he had an extra one at her location. She said she couldn't be with someone her participated in misogyny. They reconciled later that day.
